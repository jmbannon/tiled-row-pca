# Tiled Row Principal Component Analysis
A work-in-progress implementation of a distributed variant of traditional principal component analysis.

Current TODO:
- Column major single block matrices to be compatible with Fortran w/out transpose.
- Wrapper to QR decomposition w/householder WY storage (Golub, Van Loan)
- Possible OpenMP support
